    <b><em>Basics of the Web</em></b><br>
      <p>The web consists of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) code that is connected by URLs (Uniform Resource Locator). <br>
        Web applications use HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to get and send the HTML code.<br>
        The Internet was invented in the 1990's and has over 30 billion pages.</p>
    <b><em>Major Parts</em></b><br>
      <p>How the internet works as a whole is first me, my computer, and whatever browser I am using.<br> 
        Then my browser connects to the internet and streams HTTP to servers.<br>
        The data requested in the HTTP is sent in packets and folders to my computers browser to display for me to see and interact with.</p>
    <b><em>HTML</em></b><br>
      <p>HTML is made up of different things. First is text content, or what you see. Second is markup, or what it looks like.<br>
        Third is references to other documents, like images and videos. Fourth is hyper links (or links) to other pages</p>
    <b><em>HTML Markup</em></b><br>
      <p>HTML markup uses tags that add things to the webpage. They go like this: <, name, > (opening tag); content; <, /, name, >(closing tag).<br>
        All of this together is known as a element.</p>
    <b><em>HTML Attributes</em></b><br>
      <p>A HTML attribute specifies the value for a input element.<br>
        This is coded like this: < Tag attr = "value" > contents < / tag ></p>
     <b><em>Images</em></b><br>
      <p>Images can be put into the webpage with this: < img src = "url" alt = "text" >.<br>
        Images is a void tag, which means that it does not need a closing tag. </p>
     <b><em>Whitespace</em></b><br>
       <p>When coding and wanting it to show up on different lines on the webpage, you need to put in one of two things: < br >, or < p ><br>
         With its needed closing tags of: < /br >, and < /p >
     <b><em>Inline / Block</em></b><br>
       <p>There are two types of text, inline and block.<br>
         Inline text is displayed without line breaks.<br>
         Block text is displayed with line breaks where they start, and end, on a new line.</p>
     <b><em>HTML Documents</em></b><br>
        <p>HTML documents are created with a basic outline:<br>
          < html > (says that this code is a HTML code)<br>
          < head > (the first part of the code where any images, videos, java, and so on is referenced and is where the title is)<br>
          < title > (the name of the webpage) < /title ><br>
          < /head > <br>
          < body ><br>
           (where all the webpage is coded in)<br>
          < /body > <br>
          < /html > <br>
